# Telegram Video Downloader

Chrome extension to download videos from Telegram Web — supports both [Web K](https://web.telegram.org/k/) and [Web A](https://web.telegram.org/a/).

## Features

- **Inline download button** — automatically appears below videos in chat once they're loaded
- **Media viewer download** — download button in the topbar when viewing videos fullscreen
- Works with blob URLs generated by Telegram's encrypted media pipeline
- Manifest V3, no external dependencies

## How it works

1. A `MutationObserver` watches for `<video>` elements appearing in the DOM
2. Each video element is monitored for `src` attribute changes
3. When a video gets a `blob:` URL (meaning it's loaded/playing), a download button is injected below it
4. Clicking the button fetches the blob, creates a file, and triggers a save dialog via `chrome.downloads`

## Install

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
4. Click **Load unpacked** → select the project folder
5. Open [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org/) and play a video — a download button will appear

## Usage

- **In chat**: Play a video → a "Download" button appears below it
- **In media viewer**: Click a video to open fullscreen → download button appears in the top-right toolbar
